Moofar Fixed Site
-----------------
This ZIP contains updated HTML files with consistent fixes applied:
- index.html
- about.html
- contact.html
- services.html
- css/style.css
- js/main.js

What I changed:
- Added skip links and <main id="main-content"> for accessibility
- Added canonical and Open Graph meta tags for SEO
- Replaced logo filename reference to assets/moofar-logo.jpg (rename your image accordingly)
- Added loading="lazy" to images
- Improved mobile menu accessibility (aria-expanded) via js/main.js
- Added favicons references and consistent footer/header across pages

To use:
- Place your assets (images) in assets/ with the filenames mentioned (moofar-logo.jpg, mox.webp, farai.webp)
- Serve the files from a static host (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)

If you'd like, I can:
- Minify files
- Replace emoji icons with SVG icon set
- Generate optimized image assets
